    Established in 2009, after the lack of transparency on Facebook leaving many users dissatisfied over the use of their data. This app was created to allow users to retrieve data off the platform, and restrict third-party apps from accessing personal data. Six months after the succesful lauch of the app helping over a dozen users protect themselves. Facebook launched a similar version within the app after receiving unsavory feedback, they began to require all users to upgrade to ver 2.0 of their API. This would restrict other tracking third-party apps, and alas. This unfortunently led to the discontinuation of "Give me My Data," which was a utilitarian approach to that relied on the Facebooks platform which rejected the App notices with no resolution.</p>
